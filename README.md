## Creating a Jenkins Server with Terraform
1. **On your local machine**, make sure you've configured AWS CLI with your credentials.
2. **Download the entire repository as Zip** extract it and apply the Terraform script to provision the infrastructure.
3. **As output**, you'll get the EC2 instanceâ€™s public IP address. Use this IP to access the Jenkins server on port 8080: `IP_Address:8080`.
4. **To get the initial password**
     * SSH into the EC2 instance using the provided `dev-assign.pem` key (user: `ubuntu`): 
       `ssh -i /path/to/dev-assign.pem ubuntu@IP_Address`
     * Wait for 5 minutes for the Jenkins and Docker installation to complete, to follow up on the installation process, use:
       `sudo less +F /var/log/cloud-init-output.log`
     * Extract the password:
       `sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword`
5. Now you can run through the initial setup, create user and pipelines

## Creating the pipeline in Jenkins
1. First, to push the image into your Dockerhub repository, add your credentials to Jenkins:
     * In the dashboard, click on Manage Jenkins
     * Then, Credentials
     * Click on "global"
     * Add credentials
     * Add your docker hub credentials (username-password)
     * ID: `dockerhub-crd`
     * Click on "Create"

3. Next, prepare the pipeline:
     * In the Dashboard, click on **New Item**
     * Provide a name and choose the **Pipeline** option
     * Under Pipeline - from the drop-down list, choose **Pipelile script from SCM**
     * As SCM - choose **Git**
     * Repository URL - `https://github.com/netanelcohe/devops-assignment.git`
     * Branch Specifier - `*/main`
     * Script path - `Jenkinsfile`
     * Click **Save**
4. Now, you can build the pipeline.
5. Check the build logs for failures to diagnose any issues.

## Testing the app
1. SSH into the EC2 with the provided dev-assign.pem key (user - `ubuntu`)
   `ssh -i dev-assign.pem ubuntu@IP_Address`
2. Verify that the netcalc docker is running
   `docker ps`
4. Then, run the client script
   `python3 /var/lib/jenkins/client.py`
